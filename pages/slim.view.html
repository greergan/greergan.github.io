<div class="intro">
	<p>Inspired by Deno remote imports; there is now a rendering engine that supports remote view inclusion.
		With Slim.View it is possible to import HTML assets from either remote locations on the Web or from the local file system.

	<p>Use Slim.View as part of a Typescript web server stack or as part of a static website generator.
		<a href="/slim.generator">Slim.Generator</a> is an example of a static site generator.</p>
